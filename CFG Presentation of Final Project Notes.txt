CFG Presentation of Final Project:


* What I made: Job Scorer
   * Show page working
* Dive into the code
   * VS Code, has comments to guide you through
* I struggled with:
   * Making something not too ugly, design is not my thing
   * I struggled with making quiz questions visible and invisible as well as getting the score to go through correctly and not reset. I looked through previous bits of code we had shared during the course and scavenged to find the right bits. 
   * Variables inside functions only work inside the own function, kept forgetting the output version.
* I am pretty happy with what I did, I think I wouldn’t do anything else differently to be honest.
* If I were to expand I’d probably like to set up a feature so users can set up their own questions and variable weight values to each of the options.
